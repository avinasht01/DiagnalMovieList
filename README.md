# DiagnalMovieList
Project fetches list of movies from stored json files and displays in the from of collection view.

Pagination is enabled to fetch the movie list one after the other page when the user reaches to the end of page items.

It currently fetches only 3 movie page details which includes list of movies.

As per the doc shared for workshop the file didnt had spacing values so have optimised the values of spacing as per most applications.

MVVM architecture is implemented to maintain the source code.

Added search bar to handle movie list search.

Added native activity indicator to display while loading details of next page.

No 3rd party libraries were required.

Handle exception case of no image and long name for movie detail.
